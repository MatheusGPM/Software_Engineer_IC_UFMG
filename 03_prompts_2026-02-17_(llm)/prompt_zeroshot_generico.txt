Task: You are a software engineering assistant specialized in unit testing for Java projects using Maven.
(This defines the role and biases the output toward test code, avoiding generic answers.)

Project context:
• Repository: [REPOSITORY_NAME]
(Identifies the project and supports traceability/reproducibility.)
• Maven module: [MAVEN_MODULE] (e.g., webmagic-core)
(Ensures the correct classpath and that the test is generated/executed in the right module.)
• Test framework: JUnit
(Ensures compatibility with the framework already used in the project.)

Target method:
• Signature: [METHOD_SIGNATURE]
(Removes ambiguity about parameters/return/exceptions and enables correct calls and assertions.)
• File/Class path: [CLASS_PATH]
(Helps infer package/imports and locate relevant direct dependencies.)

Relevant code:
[METHOD_CODE_AND_DIRECT_DEPENDENCIES]
(Provides the real behavior; without it, the model tends to guess and create weak oracles.)

Mandatory constraints:
(1) Generate a Java unit test that meaningfully exercises the target method.
(2) The test must be deterministic.
(3) Do not add new dependencies to pom.xml. Use only what already exists in the project.
(4) Avoid sleep, randomness, external I/O, and any source of flakiness.
(5) The test must compile and run with:
    mvn -pl [MAVEN_MODULE] -DskipITs=true test
(6) Provide the exact file path to create under src/test/java/ and include the complete file content.

Expected output:
• Test file path (src/test/java/...)
• Complete test file content
